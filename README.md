I bult a simple but working AI web scraper where you can enter a website to scrape and then use AI to parse through and ask questions and/or format the data.
I used Bright Data credits for scraping and Ollama for downloading implementing ollama3.1 for the AI to fullfil prompts.
I used this project to learn more about python and what it has to offer and of course to learn how to scrape data from the web and use AI to filter/format.
